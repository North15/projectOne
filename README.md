# projectOne 
WhiteSpace Interpreter written in Visual C#

# projectPurpose:

When I was learning WhiteSpace in a Programming Languages class, I decided to make this application on the side. I found it helpful to convert my WhiteSpace into readable letters, and I hope you will too. Feel free to check out the code or submit a pull request.

# projectFeatures:
 - Import files into the application for conversion
 - You can save the converted text into a .txt file
 - You can convert between WhiteSpace and Letters by clicking the convert button
 
 # projectPlans:
 - Nothing new planned at this time
 
 # projectFiles
 The-Program folder has the .exe that you can download.                                           
    The-Code folder has all the code for Visual Studio.
