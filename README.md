# projectOne
WhiteSpace Interpreter written in Visual C#

# Purpose of this project:

I wrote this application for my Programming Languages class. The teacher had us 
learn Whitespace and I wanted an interperter to convert my Whitespace programs into radaable letters.
I hope that people find this useful and if you want, please feel free to play around with the code.

# Features:
 - Import files into the applicatio for conversion
 - You can save the convert text into a .txt file
 
 # Things I am planning on adding:
 - Ability to convert back and forth between the code and letters
