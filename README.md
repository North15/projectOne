# projectOne 
WhiteSpace Interpreter written in Visual C#

# Purpose of this project:

I wrote this application for my Programming Languages class. The teacher had us 
learn Whitespace and I wanted an interperter to convert my Whitespace programs into readable letters.
I hope that people find this useful and if you want, please feel free to play around with the code.

# Features:
 - Import files into the application for conversion
 - You can save the converted text into a .txt file
 - You can convert between WhiteSpace and Letters by clicking the convert button
 
 # Things I am planning on adding:
 - Nothing new planned at this time
 
 # The file system
 The-Program folder has the .exe that you can download.                                           
    The-Code folder has all the code for Visual Studio.
